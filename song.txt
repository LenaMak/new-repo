Bless 'em and there ain't no stress
And this one is straight for di girldem
Enrique Iglesias 'longside Gente de Zona (Deceme)
Get di girl them in a di zone
And there's a Big Bone
Sean a-Paul a me deh ya what me tell 'em 'pon the throne
Lockin' it just like that
Di girldem dem move 'pon track
Sean a-Paul a me deh ya
Enrique, sing to dem, do it

You look at me and, girl, you take me to another place
(Becah mi need it baby girl)
Got me feeling like I'm flying, like I'm out of space
Something 'bout your body says, "Come and take me"
(Becah mi need it baby girl)
Got me begging, got me hoping that the night don't stop
(Rock that body cah we don't stop party)
